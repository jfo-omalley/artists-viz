#Enriching nodes

If you would like to add your research on an artist collected here, you can that information directly to the "data.json" file. The "Image" attribute will display images if given a valid url that passes directly to the image file. 

Otherwise, you can add any attribute you like by adding it as:

{"Your attribute name":"Information about the attribute"}

#Follow the story

See the artist Mickalene Thomas as a starting point for understanding how to enrich the nodes and ideate creative research topics.
